Key Features
1.	Player Management
o	Registration: Easily add and manage up to six players for each tournament.
o	Profiles: Maintain detailed player profiles, including names and performance statistics.
2.	Tournament Structure
o	Three Rounds of Play: Organize the tournament into three competitive rounds, where each player faces three different opponents.
o	Match Pairings: Intelligent pairing algorithms match players with similar performance records while avoiding rematches.
o	Finals (Optional): An optional final match between the top two players, when the rankings are identical at the end, determines the tournament champion, ensuring a decisive and exciting conclusion.
3.	Scoring and Ranking
o	Match Points: Assign points based on match outcomes (win, draw, loss) to accurately reflect player performance.
o	Comprehensive Tiebreakers: Implement advanced tiebreaker rules, including Opponents' Match-Win Percentage (OMW%), Game-Win Percentage (GW%), and Opponents' Game-Win Percentage (OGW%), ensuring precise and fair player rankings.
1.	Opponents' Match-Win Percentage (OMW%): This measures the strength of the opponents a player has faced. It is the average win percentage of all the player’s opponents. The idea is that if you played against stronger opponents (who won more of their matches), your OMW% will be higher, reflecting the difficulty of your matchups. This is calculated by dividing the number of matches won by the opponents by the total number of matches they played.
2.	Game-Win Percentage (GW%): GW% focuses on individual games rather than matches. It is the percentage of games that the player has won out of the total number of games they've played. This shows how dominant a player has been in their games, even if they lost some matches.
3.	Opponents' Game-Win Percentage (OGW%): Similar to OMW%, OGW% calculates the average game-win percentage of all the player’s opponents. This further refines ranking by considering how well a player's opponents performed at the game level. It helps differentiate between players who faced strong opponents with consistent game performance versus weaker opponents.
4.	Real-Time Standings
o	Dynamic Leaderboard: Display current standings with all relevant statistics, updated in real-time as matches conclude.
o	Champion Announcement: Clearly identify and announce the tournament champion upon completion of all rounds and finals.
5.	Reset Functionality
o	Tournament Reset: Easily reset the tournament to clear all existing data, allowing organizers to start fresh for new events without residual information from previous tournaments.
6.	Advanced Features
o	Scheduling Tools: Advanced scheduling options to manage match times, ensuring efficient use of time and resources.
o	Reporting and Analytics: Generate detailed reports and visualizations on player performance, match outcomes, and overall tournament statistics.
o	Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
o	Gamification Elements: Introduce achievements, badges, and leaderboards to enhance player engagement and motivation.
o	Secure Data Handling: Implement robust security measures to protect player data and ensure the integrity of tournament information.
